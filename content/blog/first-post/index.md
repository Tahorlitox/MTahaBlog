I recently attended a Microsoft Azure event in Casablanca.  
One of the speakers said something that really caught my attention:

> **“Even with AI, we need more developers.”**

At first, it sounds surprising. Isn’t AI supposed to _replace_ us?

Not really.

AI helps us **go faster**, but it doesn't replace:
- Creativity
- Problem-solving
- Product thinking 
- Human communication

Tools like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot make coding easier — but someone still has to **know what to build**, **how to structure it**, and **how to make it useful**.

---

### Bottom line?

> **AI is not replacing developers. It’s replacing slow developers.**

So if you're learning to code or thinking of switching to tech:  
**You're not late. You're right on time.**
